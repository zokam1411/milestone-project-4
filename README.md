## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Construction üë∑

The application uses Django 3 which is one of the most popular development tools. The project uses Separation of Concern amongst the applications to utilise the Django Framework effectively.

In addition to using Django, sqlite was used in the early stages of the project as a test database for local testing. Sqlite is an independent, highly reliable SQL database engine that supports all normal relational database management functions. Before deployment, I switched to Postgres witch is open source software that provides a fully technical and easy-to-use object-oriented relational database management system.

Thanks to Django, the application administrator has full access to a completely custom admin dashboard where he can create, read, update and delete records in any proposed application model as needed.

For the testing of the store and subscriptions, a test credit card can be used by inputting the following details:
- Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Exp date: 04/24
- CVC: 424
- ZIP: 42424

### Design:

#### Color Scheme:

The main three colors in the app:

- ![007A47](docs/readmeimages/007A47.jpg) #007A47 used as a background for navbar

- ![198754](docs/readmeimages/198754.jpg) #198754 bootstrap "success" color used to higlight text and for buttons

- ![1F2A34](docs/readmeimages/1F2A34.jpg) #1F2A34 used as footer background

#### Typography:

The "Lato" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fall back font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly.
Lato offers a pleasing reading ability to the user and is easy on the eyes. Font is  clean, professional and very readable amongst all major languages.

#### Content Structure:

The application is primarily rectangular shaped. Buttons, cards have sharp edges to create consistent view for the user. Content is grouped in sections, an example of this would be the Home page:
- The main body of the page is horizontally separated into sections, we have a hero section, about section where user can read  about the club, and finally we have membership section where are informations about membership. Page is finished by footer where user can find quick site links, club address, email address and social links.

#### Wireframes:

The first raw design wos drawn on a piece of paper and then the idea was transferred to an advanced creator.

<p id="testing"></p>

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Testing üî•

<p id="manualtesting"></p>

### Manual Testing:

Testing and improving the application was carried out throughout its development. The main testing tool was Google Chrome dev tools and devices such as phone, tablet and laptop with several versions of browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera).

Bootstrap5 framework was tested extensively to ensure application is mobile friendly. The Application was tested on my Lenovo Thinkbook laptop and large Samsung TV screen, Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile and Lenovo tablet. The application worked fine on all devices. If something didn't work as it should during the test it was immediately checked and corrected in DevTools and then implemented into the code and checked again. If test passed it was committed and pushed into repository.

Python based code was checked and tested using PEP8 online validator and finished without any errors.

JavaScript and jQuery were tested using JS Hint and finished without errors.

CSS was validated using W3C's Jigsaw Validator and finished without errors.

Passing the HTML file content through the W3C Validator for HTML resulted in numerous errors triggered by Jinja's framework embedded within the document. The standard HTML is W3C compliant, no other errors found.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment üöÄ

This project was developed in GitPod and deployed to Heroku for production.

### Deploying to Heroku

In order to deploy to heroku I:

1. In Heroku I created a new app. I clicked on 'NEW' button and from dropdown menu I selected 'Create New App'. I set app name and chose region closest to me.
2. Once the app was created I went to Resources tab and in Add-ons search bar I typed Postgress and selected Heroku Postgres. I selected Hobby Dev - Free and added it to my project.
3. Next I went to Settings tab and from Reveal Config Vars I copied:
- DATABASE_URL Key.
4. I set DATABASE_URL in env.py
5. To be able to deploy my Django project to Heroku I installed in gitpod required packages:
- gunicorn
- psycopg2-binary
- dj-database-url
6. From the command line in gitpod I have created a requirements.txt file with the following command:
```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
7. From the command line in gitpod I have created the Procfile with the following command:
```
echo web: gunicorn rc_club.wsgi:application > Procfile
```
8. In settings.py file I imported dj_database_url
9. In settings.py file I updated default database:
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
10. From the command line in GitPod I migrated the database models to Posgres:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
11. From the command line in GitPod I created superuser for Postgres:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
12. From the command line in GitPod I logged in to Heroku:
```
heroku login -i
```
13. From the command line in GitPod I temporarily disable collect static files:
```
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
```
14. In setting.py I updated Allowed Hosts:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['ffrccc-project.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
15. Finally I pushed evrything to my GitHub:
```
git add .
git commit -m
git push
```
16. To deploy to heroku I initialize my heroku git remote by typing in GitPod command line:
```
heroku git:remote -a ffrccc-project
```
17. Then pushed by typing command:
```
git push heroku master
```
18. After this I checked my Heroku, clicked on 'Open App' button and my app was successfully deployed but without static files yet.
19. Once in Heroku, in 'Deploy' tab I connected app to GitHub to enabled automatic deploys.
20. In Settings tab in Config Variables I set SECRET_KEY
21. In setting.py I changed DEBUG settings:
```
DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
```
22. The static files and media files for this deployed site (e.g. products images) are hosted in the AWS S3 Bucket. In order to upload files I created:
- AWS account.
- Bucket Policy
- Group
- Access Policy
- User

23. To connect Django to S3 bucket I installed two new packages using GitPod command line:
```
pip3 install boto3
```
```
pip3 install django storages
```
24. I freeze installed packages to requirements.txt.
25. I added 'storages' into INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
26. I added following into settings.py:
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'ffrccc-project'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
27. I added <a href="custom_storages.py">custom_storages.py</a> file.
28. Next in Heroku in Settings tab in Reveal Config Vars I added my AWS environmental variables:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- USE_AWS = True
29. From the same location I removed DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable as it was not longer needed.
30. In GitPod I pushed all changes to GitHub and automatically to Heroku.
31. After this I checked my Heroku, clicked on 'Open App' button and my app was successfully deployed including static files.
32. In order to send real emails from the application, you need to connect it to your Gmail account, setting up your email address in EMAIL_HOST_USER variable and your app password generated by your email provider in EMAIL_HOST_PASS variable.
33. Next in Heroku in Settings tab in Reveal Config Vars I added my AWS environmental variables:
- EMAIL_HOST_PASS
- EMAIL_HOST_USER
34. Finally I added Stripe to the rest of Heroku Config Variables in Settings tab:
- STRIPE_MEMBERSHIP_WH_SECRET
- STRIPE_PRICE_ID
- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- STRIPE_WH_SECRET

### Local Deployment

To be able to run this project, the following tools have to be installed:

- An IDE of your choice (I used GitPod for creating this project)
- Git
- PIP
- Python3

Apart from that, you also need to create accounts with the following services:
- Stripe
- AWS to setup the S3 basket
- Gmail

1. You can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the following command into the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/zokam1411/milestone-project-4
```
Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the Code button and select Download ZIP and after extract the zip file to your folder.

In the terminal window of your local IDE change the directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).

2. Set up environment variables.

Note, that this process will be different depending on IDE you use.

In this it was done using the following way:

- Create .env file in the root directory.
- Add .env to the .gitignore file in your project's root directory
- In .env file set environment variables with the following syntax:
```
import os  
os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your SECRET_KEY>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your STRIPE_WH_SECRET">"
os.environ["STRIPE_PRICE_ID"] = "<Your STRIPE_PRICE_ID>"
os.environ["STRIPE_MEMBERSHIP_WH_SECRET"] = "<STRIPE_MEMBERSHIP_WH_SECRET>"
os.environ["DOMAIN_URL"] = "<Your DOMAIN_URL>/membership/"
```     

3. Install all requirements from the requirements.txt file putting this command into your terminal:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. In the terminal in your IDE migrate the models to crete a database using the following commands:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
5. Create a superuser to have an access to the the admin panel(you need to follow the instructions then and insert username,email and password):
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
6. You will now be able to run the application using the following command:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
7. To access the admin panel, you can add the /admin path at the end of the url link and login using your superuser credentials.
