## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Construction üë∑

The application uses Django 3 which is one of the most popular development tools. The project uses Separation of Concern amongst the applications to utilise the Django Framework effectively.

In addition to using Django, sqlite was used in the early stages of the project as a test database for local testing. Sqlite is an independent, highly reliable SQL database engine that supports all normal relational database management functions. Before deployment, I switched to Postgres witch is open source software that provides a fully technical and easy-to-use object-oriented relational database management system.

Thanks to Django, the application administrator has full access to a completely custom admin dashboard where he can create, read, update and delete records in any proposed application model as needed.

For the testing of the store and subscriptions, a test credit card can be used by inputting the following details:
- Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Exp date: 04/24
- CVC: 424
- ZIP: 42424
