## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Construction üë∑

The application uses Django 3 which is one of the most popular development tools. The project uses Separation of Concern amongst the applications to utilise the Django Framework effectively.

In addition to using Django, sqlite was used in the early stages of the project as a test database for local testing. Sqlite is an independent, highly reliable SQL database engine that supports all normal relational database management functions. Before deployment, I switched to Postgres witch is open source software that provides a fully technical and easy-to-use object-oriented relational database management system.

Thanks to Django, the application administrator has full access to a completely custom admin dashboard where he can create, read, update and delete records in any proposed application model as needed.

For the testing of the store and subscriptions, a test credit card can be used by inputting the following details:
- Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Exp date: 04/24
- CVC: 424
- ZIP: 42424

### Design:

#### Color Scheme:

The main three colors in the app:

- ![007A47](docs/readmeimages/007A47.jpg) #007A47 used as a background for navbar

- ![198754](docs/readmeimages/198754.jpg) #198754 bootstrap "success" color used to higlight text and for buttons

- ![1F2A34](docs/readmeimages/1F2A34.jpg) #1F2A34 used as footer background

#### Typography:

The "Lato" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fall back font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly.
Lato offers a pleasing reading ability to the user and is easy on the eyes. Font is  clean, professional and very readable amongst all major languages.

#### Content Structure:

The application is primarily rectangular shaped. Buttons, cards have sharp edges to create consistent view for the user. Content is grouped in sections, an example of this would be the Home page:
- The main body of the page is horizontally separated into sections, we have a hero section, about section where user can read  about the club, and finally we have membership section where are informations about membership. Page is finished by footer where user can find quick site links, club address, email address and social links.

#### Wireframes:

The first raw design wos drawn on a piece of paper and then the idea was transferred to an advanced creator.

<p id="testing"></p>

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing üî•

<p id="manualtesting"></p>

### Manual Testing:

Testing and improving the application was carried out throughout its development. The main testing tool was Google Chrome dev tools and devices such as phone, tablet and laptop with several versions of browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera).

Bootstrap5 framework was tested extensively to ensure application is mobile friendly. The Application was tested on my Lenovo Thinkbook laptop and large Samsung TV screen, Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile and Lenovo tablet. The application worked fine on all devices. If something didn't work as it should during the test it was immediately checked and corrected in DevTools and then implemented into the code and checked again. If test passed it was committed and pushed into repository.

Python based code was checked and tested using PEP8 online validator and finished without any errors.

JavaScript and jQuery were tested using JS Hint and finished without errors.

CSS was validated using W3C's Jigsaw Validator and finished without errors.

Passing the HTML file content through the W3C Validator for HTML resulted in numerous errors triggered by Jinja's framework embedded within the document. The standard HTML is W3C compliant, no other errors found.
