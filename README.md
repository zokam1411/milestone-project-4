This Milestone project is a summary of learning and study from all modules of the Full Stack Developer Course, culminating in the creation of this Full Stack Framework Django project.

FFRCCC is a radio controlled car club. There are a number of users that the website will target and each of these user types will have a different need when using the website.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Construction üë∑

The application uses Django 3 which is one of the most popular development tools. The project uses Separation of Concern amongst the applications to utilise the Django Framework effectively.

In addition to using Django, sqlite was used in the early stages of the project as a test database for local testing. Sqlite is an independent, highly reliable SQL database engine that supports all normal relational database management functions. Before deployment, I switched to Postgres witch is open source software that provides a fully technical and easy-to-use object-oriented relational database management system.

Thanks to Django, the application administrator has full access to a completely custom admin dashboard where he can create, read, update and delete records in any proposed application model as needed.

For the testing of the store and subscriptions, a test credit card can be used by inputting the following details:
- Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Exp date: 04/24
- CVC: 424
- ZIP: 42424

### Design:

#### Color Scheme:

The main three colors in the app:

- ![007A47](docs/readmeimages/007A47.jpg) #007A47 used as a background for navbar

- ![198754](docs/readmeimages/198754.jpg) #198754 bootstrap "success" color used to higlight text and for buttons

- ![1F2A34](docs/readmeimages/1F2A34.jpg) #1F2A34 used as footer background

#### Typography:

The "Lato" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fall back font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly.
Lato offers a pleasing reading ability to the user and is easy on the eyes. Font is  clean, professional and very readable amongst all major languages.

#### Content Structure:

The application is primarily rectangular shaped. Buttons, cards have sharp edges to create consistent view for the user. Content is grouped in sections, an example of this would be the Home page:
- The main body of the page is horizontally separated into sections, we have a hero section, about section where user can read  about the club, and finally we have membership section where are informations about membership. Page is finished by footer where user can find quick site links, club address, email address and social links.

#### Wireframes:

The first raw design wos drawn on a piece of paper and then the idea was transferred to an advanced creator.

1. Search bar which filters the results down by taking the search criteria and matching it to the product title, the product description. If nothing is entered into the search box when the user presses submits a search query, the page will a toast error message to let the user know he needs to enter search criteria to search the store.

2. Above the products on the left user can find a total count of the number of items currently listed on the page. If a category has been chosen, the count will show the category selected and the total number of ptoducts e.g "Accessories (4)". If the user has used the search box, instead total producs user will see e.g 'Search query: "motor"'.

3. Above the products on the right user can find a sort dropdown which lets the user sort by 6 different criteria - Price (high - low), price (low - high), name (a - z), name (z - a), category (a - z), category (z -a).

On the right side of the bag page, there is summary section that shows Total, Discount, Delivery and Grand Total. This way, user is able to check the order summary at first glance even if he has added a lot of products to the shopping cart.

The details is a form when, if logged in, lets the user save their information to their profile for a quicker checkout next time. The order summary is similar to the basket page, and shows the breakdown of the amounts with the option ot edit the basket and a final summary of how much will be charged. The final feature on the page is the payment information which uses Stripe to handle the payments. A successfull payment will take the users to the order success page showing the order summary.

Logged in user have access to profile page. The profile page is split into two sections, delivery details and order history. The delivery details is a simple form and has an 'update information' button below to update their details on their profile, which would also reflect on the delivery details on the checkout page.

The order history shows a summary of the users previous orders. It is in the layout of a table and shows the order number, date, items and the grand total. Clicking the order number would take the user to the order summary where they would see a more detailed breakdown of the order.
