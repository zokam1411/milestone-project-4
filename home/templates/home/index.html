                        and experienced, and catering for electric RC cars on one of our expertly-designed indoor
                        carpet
                        track. The venue is set up with a full PA system and we use the latest Mylaps RC4 timing

                    <p><b>What we race:</b>
                        At the FFRCCC we race electric cars only. The cars are 1/10th scale off-road, well-known
                        brands like Associated, X-Ray, Schumacher and Yokomo. There are a number of different brands
                        and
                        routes you can take to get into RC car racing, but the best way is to come to club and talk
                        to our
                        members before you buy anything.</p>

                    <p><b>When we race:</b>
                        Racing is held every Sunday from 10am until approx. 5pm. We have a practise night on
                        Wednesday
                        evenings. We also host two multi-round championships each year.
                        Every Sunday there are between 20 and 35 racers, making it one of the more popular clubs in
                        Ireland.
                        We have racers from 7 years old to a lot older.</p>
